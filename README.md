# RobotCode
Led Software Team of three members to deliver robot code for a FRC Robot within a six week frame. Wrote code for autonomous path planning utilizing motor encoders and an IMU. Utilized PID controllers and motion profiling algorithms for safe and effective movement of a robotic arm and a robotic climber mechanism.
